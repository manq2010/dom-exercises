    <!-- Method 1 -->

    <button onclick="alert('Hello World')">Click Me 1</button>

    <!-- This solution is less than ideal because we’re cluttering our HTML with JavaScript. Also, we can only have 1 “onclick” event per element. -->

    <!-- Method 2 -->
    <button id="btn1">Click Me 2</button>

    <!-- This is a little better. We’ve moved the JS out of the HTML and into a JS file, but we still have the problem that a DOM element can only have 1 “onclick” property. -->

    <!-- Method 3 -->
    <button id="btn2">Click Me Too</button>
    <button id="btn3">Click Me Too 1</button>
    <button id="btn4">Click Me Too 2</button>
    <button id="btn5">Click Me Too 3</button>
    <button id="btn6">Click Me Too 4</button>

    <!-- Now, we maintain separation of concerns, and we also allow multiple event listeners if the need arises. Method 3 is much more flexible and powerful, though it is a bit more complex to set up. -->

    <!-- Note that all 3 of these methods can be used with named functions like so: -->

    <button onclick="alertFunction()">CLICK ME BABY</button>
